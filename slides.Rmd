## Background

- The Information Services Division (ISD) of the National Health Service (NHS) Scotland produces around 200 official and national statistics publications each year.
- Traditional publication output is a **static pdf document** with accompanying **excel tables**.
- Production uses **proprietary software** and is **time-consuming**, involving extensive manual formatting and checking.

```{r out.width = "40%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics("images/pdf report.png")
```

## What is a RAP project?

- No (or few) manual steps = data and output produced using code
- High quality and auditable = version control
- Sustainable = peer review
- "Bells and whistles" = _functions, documenting/testing these functions, package management and computing environment_

```{r out.width = "60%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics("images/rap.jpg")
```

## [Levels of RAP/automation](https://www.isdscotland.org/About-ISD/Methodologies/_docs/Reproducible_Analytical_Pipelines_paper_v1.4.pdf)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
    kable(automation_levels,
          col.names = c("Level", "Description"),
          format = "markdown")
```

## Challenges

- Senior management buy in
- Culture change (peer review and working in the open)
- New skills for analysts to learn (R, git, etc)
- Required development time
- Range of data sources and/or unstable production process
- IT...

## IT Infrastructure

- R desktop and server versions
- RStudio Server Pro
- Package management
- git
- git-repository hosting service (GitHub/Gitea)

And what's next...? Travis? Docker?
